# OpenTerminal
---

## What is this?

A very simple plug-in for XCode that adds a short cut menu option to the File menu which opens a new iTerm window in the current project.

## How to use it?

Build the OpenTerminal target in the Xcode project and the plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. Relaunch Xcode and it will add the new menu item in the File menu.

## Background

The code packages an existing AppleScript that is called when the menu option is selected. 

## Notes

This project is compiled with garbage collection supported, and ARC disabled.

Compatible with XCode 4 and 5.
